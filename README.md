# Telecommunications_I
This repository contains two mini projects created and submitted for the course EEE431 Telecommunications I, provided by Bilkent University Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department. 

## Course Content
This is the first course in the series of two senior level courses on telecommunications aiming to introduce the basic principles behind the analysis and design of  modern communication systems. The main goal of this course is to introduce the concepts of modulation and demodulation of information and the effect of noise on system performance. The topics that will be covered are spectral analysis of signals and systems, baseband representation of carrier modulated signals, random processes, continuous wave modulation (AM and FM) and their noise analysis, pulse modulation.
